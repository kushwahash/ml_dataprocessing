We can use below resources to understand and learn more about the differenct techniques used.

A)
To scale data, following can be used
1. Normalization, which scales all numeric variables in the range [0,1]. One possible formula is given below:
   Xnew = (X - Xmin)/(Xmax-Xmin)


2.Standardization on your data set. It will then transform it to have zero mean and unit variance.
  Xnew = (X - mean(X))/(Standard Deviation of X)

Standard Deviation  = measure of spread (whether a data point is near to mean (standard) or away from the mean(deviated))
